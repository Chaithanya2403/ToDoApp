# ToDoApp
The app allows you to add tasks, list tasks, mark them as completed, and persist them in a JSON file so your data is saved between runs.
# Features
➕ Add new tasks with descriptions

📋 List all tasks with status (✔️ done / ❌ pending)

✅ Mark tasks as completed

💾 Automatic saving of tasks to tasks.json

🔄 Automatic loading of tasks when the app starts

# How It Works
When the app starts, it loads existing tasks from tasks.json (if present).
You interact with a simple menu:
1. Add Task
2. List Tasks
3. Mark Task as Done
4. Exit
Each action updates the task list, which is saved automatically.
